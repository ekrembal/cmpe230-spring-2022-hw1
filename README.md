# TODOS

- expr1, expr2, expr3 and expr4 are expressions that evaluate to a scalar -> You should check whether it is scalar expression. 
- use Variadic arguments on the function call to pass multiple numbers to assignment
- A[sqrt(4)], A[i+5-2+j], or A[choose(i,1,2,3)] are valid
- You can assume   that   matrices [1,1]   cannot be considered as scalars.
- All expressions inside of choose must be scalar as stated in the project description.
- Upper limit in characters of line is -> you can take it as 256 as 256
- tr and sqrt do not modify the matrix, returns a new matrix
- default values are 0 for all variables
- For simplicity, you can assume you will have constant numbers in the  curly brackets of  vector/matrix initializers. 
- y[1] = 3 is valid
